# Project README FORREAL ENGINE TSBK07

## Overview
This project is a C/C++ application that includes several components related to a game engine. Below is a brief description of each file and its functionality. Link to the trailer for FORREAL ENGINE, that showcase the key functionality of the program. https://youtu.be/osctUqixOxU?feature=shared

## Files and Descriptions

1. **Billboard.cpp**
   - Manages billboard objects within the game, which are typically used for 2D representations in a 3D environment.

2. **Camera.cpp**
   - Implements camera functionality, allowing for various types of camera controls and perspectives within the game.

3. **GUI.cpp**
   - Handles the graphical user interface elements, enabling interaction with the game through menus, buttons, and other UI components.

4. **GameMode.cpp**
   - Defines different game modes, providing mechanisms to switch between various game states and rules.

5. **GameObject.cpp**
   - Represents game objects, including their properties and behaviors, serving as the base class for all entities in the game.

6. **InputController.cpp**
   - Manages user input from various devices, processing and responding to player actions within the game.

7. **Picking.cpp**
   - Implements picking functionality, allowing the user to interact with objects in the game world through selection mechanisms.

8. **Terrain.cpp**
   - Handles the creation and management of terrain, including terrain generation and rendering within the game environment.

9. **Utils.cpp**
   - Contains utility functions and helper methods that are used across various parts of the project to perform common tasks.

10. **run.cpp**
    - The main entry point of the application, initializing and starting the game, and orchestrating the interaction between different components.

11. **ext**
    - All the files in ext are credited to our examiner Ingemar Ragnemalm and who ever he has credited.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
   - Any required libraries should be installed and configured (e.g., OpenGL for rendering).

2. **Compilation**
   - Compile the project using your preferred C++ build system:
     ```sh
     make
     ```

3. **Running the Application**
   - Execute the compiled binary:
     ```sh
     ./run
     ```
